# JuliaDistro

This repo contains build scripts for Julia distributions, in particular the
Juno/Julia bundle.

Please see [this thread](http://discuss.junolab.org/t/new-juno-julia-bundles/13)
for betas and testing.

This is tested only on my laptop (OS X) and isn't guaranteed to work anywhere
else (or at all, for that matter).
